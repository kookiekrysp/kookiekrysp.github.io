      <img src="images/header-roses.jpg" height="300" alt="A close up of a bouquet of peach and ivory colored roses">

      <p><strong>The focus of my reviews are as follows:</strong></p>
      <ol>
      <li>What did I liked/disliked most about the drama</li>
      <li>Was there romance, and if so, what I liked/disliked about it</li>
      <li>Who would I reccomend the drama to.</li>      
      </ol>
      <p>I believe in watching my dramas in a safe, legal, and fun environment so I highly reccomend both <a href="https://www.viki.com">Viki</a> and <a href="https://www.dramafever.com">Dramafever</a> if you are interested in a wide variety of K-dramas.<a href="https://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> is also a great option if you just want to check out a few great dramas without being overwhelmed.</p>
